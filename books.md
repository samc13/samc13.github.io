In what's a familiar story for many, I became an Engineering Manager more by accident than by design. 

Without any formal training, I've been left to simply do my best. Along the way, I've had some great mentors and I've been recommended some excellent books. 

Here's a short list of some recommendations that I can endorse: 

* [The Manager's Path](https://amzn.eu/d/b6C3BoC) - Camille Fournier 
* [Nine Lies About Work](https://amzn.eu/d/br9iraS) - Marcus Buckingham, Ashley Goodall

I had the pleasure of attending Camille Fournier's talk at London's LDX3 LeadDev Conference in 2025, where she explored how and when to actually re-write a system - or more accurately, how often it's a better choice to re-architect it.
