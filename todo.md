* Finish implementing colour palette and integration with Tailwind (use Tailwind vars more across components)
* Allow user to select preferred theme and store as a cookie
* Add icons package and use that for socials, rather than emojis
* Replace tab favicon with own image
* Add navigation (bar?)
* Link out to blog posts
