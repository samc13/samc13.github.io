Hello there. My name is Sam.

This is a static website that I've built, hosted in GitHub pages. 
It's a small project designed with the intention of keeping me reasonably up-to-speed and/or comfortable using TypeScript/React.

I've also used it as a chance to try out using AI coding tools, particularly CoPilot.

So far at least, I've only copied standalone functions or CSS styles from CoPilot answers, rather than allowing it more agentic access to the project.
