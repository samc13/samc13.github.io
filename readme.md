# Hello.

I'm Sam. 

Here's a website. 

There's another README in `/site` which has the finer details about how to develop here and what I've used etc. 

Since this is the top-level that gets showed when you join the repo, I've kept this a little more non-technical. 

// TODO: Maybe talk about GitHub pages a little? Static deployment... blah blah. Yup, I'm committing this.
